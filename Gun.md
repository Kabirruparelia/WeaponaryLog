# I am a gun
# If you get shot by the gun, you have a 20% chance of survival if it hits an important organ.
# A gun is a ranged weapon designed to use a shooting tube to launch projectiles. The projectiles are typically solid, but can also be pressurized liquid, gas or even charged particles. Solid projectiles may be free-flying or tethered. A large-caliber gun is also called a cannon.
# Basically, I am a weapon that can send people to Jesus.
